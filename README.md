Term: Fall 2016

+ Team Name: The Santander Data Group
+ Projec title: [Santander Product Recommendation](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-product-recommendation)
+ Project Data: [Santander Data: download here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-product-recommendation/data)
+ Project Description

To support needs for a range of financial decisions, Santander Bank offers a lending hand to their customers through personalized product recommendations. Our goal is to predict which products their existing customers will use in the next month based on their past behavior and that of similar customers.

+ Contribution statement 

The whole team agreed on the study.
CH, JZ, ZC and WR discussed and designed the model evaluation protocol. 
CH, JZ, ZC and WR carried out the computation for model evaluation. 
CH prepared the presentation

Chenxi cleaned the data. 
Chenxi explored feature engineering and feature selection.
Chenxi trained mlr::rFerns and mlr::RandomForestSRC for predictions and explanations purposes. 
Chenxi prepared the presentation and is the presenter. 
Chenxi organized group meetings, Github files and project descriptions.
Chenxi also explored and researched on multi-label classification, naive bayes, multinomial and ML-KNN.

Jingdan built SVM models. ......

Skanda created the clean dataset using a lean code. Skanda also created new features, rolled up the data and ensured no loss in information. Skanda tried boosting, random forest and multinomial logistic regression for predictions. 
XX and XX developed baseline classification model for evaluation. 

Zachary built decision tree models with a specific focus on Santander savings account. Zachary developed and visualized single decision trees, prune trees, and random forest trees for predictions and explanations purposes. Zachary also built prediction results and uploaded them on github. Zachary also participated in team meetings and shared and contributed his ideas to the team.
