############## create the baseline model ##################
# this is just to determine by the majority/frequency
# for example
# say customer X has 17 records. 
# For product 1 he purchased it 15/17 times (as long as over 17/2) 
# then we just predict that he will purchase this again in the next month. 
```

```{r}
############## subset variables ##################
# we only need customer codes(representing unique customers) 
# and 12 labels (representing whether to buy products)
# other features will be ignored in this model
