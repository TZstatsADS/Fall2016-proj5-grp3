###  Contributions Statement

The whole team agreed on the study.
CH, JZ, ZC and WR discussed and designed the model evaluation protocol. 
CH, JZ, ZC and WR carried out the computation for model evaluation. 
CH prepared the presentation

Chenxi cleaned the data. 
Chenxi explored feature engineering and feature selection.
Chenxi trained mlr::rFerns and mlr::RandomForestSRC for predictions and explanations purposes. 
Chenxi prepared the presentation and is the presenter. 
Chenxi organized group meetings, Github files and project descriptions.
Chenxi also explored and researched on multi-label classification, naive bayes, multinomial and ML-KNN.
Chenxi (with William) built baseline model and evaluated the results.
Chenxi (with William) wrote the project report and organized the Github.

William coded XGBoost & Random Forest models.  Also created baseline data.  And supported efforts in data exploration, feature engineering, model building and selection, and reporting.

Jingdan built SVM and Random Forest models. Jingdan built cross-validation results of SVM and random forest. 

Skanda created the clean analytical dataset using a lean code. Skanda also created new features that explained the month on month cariation thus making it possible to roll up the data by ensuring no loss in information. Skanda tried boosting, random forest and multinomial logistic regression for predictions.

Zachary built decision tree models with a specific focus on Santander savings account. Zachary developed and visualized single decision trees, prune trees, and random forest trees for predictions and explanations purposes. Zachary also built prediction results and uploaded them on github. Zachary also participated in team meetings and shared and contributed his ideas to the team.
